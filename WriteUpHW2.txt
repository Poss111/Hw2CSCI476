I used the hydra protocol in kali linux. I used the 
command line hydra -s 22 -V -l test -P /usr/shar/wordlists/
" " 70.39.80.128 ssh. I cycled through several word lists
found in this directory which included termineter.txt, 
dnsmap.txt, and common.txt within the fern-wifi file. I 
finally used fasttrack.txt and came upon changeme for the 
password for the username "test". Then used ssh 
test@70.39.80.128 to logon to the server and got 
test@70.39.80.128's password:. I entered in changeme and 
recieve Hello test, You are not authorized to connect to
